Climate Conference Analysis
Database: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/pxMci1sLL945KHKYvpe9W6/1

This project analyses a database of 30 VIPs attending a climate conference. Using SQL queries, I explored their event participation, hotel reservations, feedback exchanges, and RSVPs, applying joins, subqueries, and filtering to answer key questions.


-- Question 1: Which VIPs are presenting and what events are they linked to? [LEFT JOIN]

SELECT v.first_name
, v.last_name
, e.event_name
FROM vips v
LEFT JOIN events e
ON v.event = e.event_id
;


-- Question 2: Which VIPs are staying in a hotel, and what are the hotel names? [INNER JOIN]

SELECT v.first_name
, v.last_name
, h.hotel_name
FROM vips v
INNER JOIN reservations r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
INNER JOIN hotels h
    ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
;


-- Question 3: Show all VIPs, their event type, and the hotel they’re staying at. [MULTIPLE JOINs]

SELECT v.first_name
, v.last_name
, e.event_name
, e.event_type
, h.hotel_name
FROM vips v
INNER JOIN events e
    ON v.event = e.event_id
INNER JOIN reservations r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
INNER JOIN hotels h
    ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
;


-- Question 4: Match each VIP with the person they are providing feedback to. [SELF JOIN]

SELECT v1.first_name AS vip_first
, v1.last_name AS vip_last
, v2.first_name AS feedback_first
, v2.last_name AS feedback_last
FROM vips v1
INNER JOIN vips v2
    ON v1.provides_feedback_to = v2.member_id
;


-- Question 5: Which VIPs joined before the average membership year? [SUBQUERY]

SELECT first_name
, last_name
, member_since
FROM vips
WHERE member_since < (
    SELECT AVG(member_since) 
    FROM vips
)
;


-- Question 6: Which VIPs RSVP’d “yes” to both the welcome party and dinner? [CHOICE]

SELECT v.first_name
, v.last_name
FROM vips v
INNER JOIN reservations r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
WHERE r.welcome_rsvp = 1 
  AND r.dinner_rsvp = 1
;
